                <h2>My Module Experience</h2>
                <p>I came into this module with no prior experience programming in HTML or CSS, however despite this I
                    believe that I have managed quite well and have found both languages to be easy to pick up,
                    especially
                    when compared to the languages used in my other programming modules. Although this does not mean I
                    did
                    not encounter any issues with web development. One of the earliest problems that I recall having was
                    when we were covering responsive websites and making a menu only appear when targeted. However,
                    after
                    several hours of re-watching the lecture and reading the slides I was finally able to make it work.
                    I
                    think I enjoyed the lectures on animations the most, as it gave me the most opportunity to be more
                    creative with what I could do with the code. And once we got into the more advanced keyframe
                    animations
                    and through some research of my own, I discovered that there is a great deal that can be done using
                    just
                    CSS to animate a website.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>Website Design</h2>
                <p>To begin with I started by looking at other websites for inspiration, I found <a
                        href="https://www.ryangittings.co.uk/">https://www.ryangittings.co.uk/</a>
                    to be the one that I liked most. This was the site that inspired me
                    to use the video background for my site, as well as the general layout of my name being in the top
                    left corner as a home button. I also used an opacity fade style in the early days of my site before
                    swapping it out for its current style.</p>
                <p>Next, I began by making a simple wireframe for my index and portfolio pages, this allowed me to have
                    a basic plan when it came to implementing the site in HTML, as I already knew which elements I would
                    need to use and where they would need to be nested. I didnâ€™t put too much detail into this wireframe
                    as I knew that I would make changes to the design as I worked on the site and did not want to spend
                    hours on a design that would not even be used for the final version. </p>
                <p>Once I began implementing the design, I ran into a few problems with the site. The first was getting
                    the video background to work, initially it would not run at all and would just display as a static
                    image, through some googling of the problem I found that for it to run on a loop it had to be set as
                    muted. I also had issues with the images used on the portfolio page, as they were all different
                    sizes; resizing them all to the same dimensions using an online image resizer tool fixed this issue.
                    Lastly I had issues with all of my CSS transitions starting as soon as the page loaded, I found out
                    that this was due to a bug in chrome and that adding a script element to the html code would fix
                    this.</p>
                <p>For the design of my site, I decided to go with a simple faded black background with white text, as
                    this would make it easier to read against the video background. I also added a black shadow effect
                    on the text to make it easier to read. I chose a typewriter style font, as I felt it matched well
                    with the blinking effect from the index page, my goal was to make the text look as if it had been
                    typed onto the page with a typewriter.</p>

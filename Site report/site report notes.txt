started with a wireframe, planned html I would use, elements etc

wrote html code

styled with css, had initial trouble getting the video to autoplay, found it had to be muted first
used googling to find how to set the video as a background
had initial problem getting the red fade effect on links to only show on the text, had to move the
hover effect from the li element to the a element

initially I only had 4 menu items, I decided to add the about me section to have a section I could go more
in detail about myself and my interests, while also making the nav menu look less empty.

to add the  typewriter effect I used code from this link and edited a little to fit my page:

used https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2570972/css-font-border to find the code for the shadow effect on
module names

initially I had issues with all the module information showing on the page when it loaded, as well as
when I closed the tab it was in, using opacity fixed this.
